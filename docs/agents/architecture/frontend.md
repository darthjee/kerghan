# Architecture — Frontend

React 19 + Vite, built and tested the same way regardless of backend language. Hash-based
routing, a `client/` HTTP layer, and a login/register/device-authorization modal already exist
(see "Auth flow" below) — the dashboard/analytics views themselves (issue volume, age, label
breakdowns, "needs attention" lists) are still to come.

## Stack

- React 19 (no React Bootstrap/UI kit chosen yet — Majora's is deliberately not carried over)
- Vite (dev server on port 8080, `npm run build` outputs to `dist/`, matching the
  `docker_volumes/static` bind mount)
- Jasmine + c8 (tests/coverage), driven through a custom Node ESM loader
  (`specs/support/jsx-loader.mjs`) that transforms `.jsx` via Babel, stubs image/CSS imports,
  and shims `import.meta.env` for Node-based specs
- ESLint (flat config, `eslint.config.mjs`) — 2-space indent, single quotes, semicolons
  required, max complexity 10, max 300 lines/file, JSDoc required on public API

Dashboard/analytics views (issue volume, age, label breakdowns, "needs attention" lists) don't
exist yet — mirror Majora's shape (`components/`, `client/`, `utils/`), already followed above,
rather than inventing a new one — see `frontend.md` in `.claude/agents/` for the full
component-extraction conventions to apply as it grows. Given `docs/agents/product.md`'s
"aggregation-friendly, not just CRUD" API design, expect the eventual dashboard `client/` layer to
fetch pre-aggregated dashboard data (counts, groupings, "needs attention" lists) rather than raw
per-issue CRUD — plus, per `docs/agents/flow.md`, some of that fetching happens directly against
GitHub's API rather than the backend at all.

## Auth flow

`client/AccountsClient.js` wraps every `auth` route the backend exposes — see
`docs/agents/modules/auth.md` for the request/response contract, not duplicated here:

- `register(fields)` — `POST /auth/register.json`
- `login({ username, password })` — `POST /auth/login.json`
- `refresh(refreshToken)` — `POST /auth/refresh.json`
- `logout(refreshToken)` — `DELETE /auth/logoff.json`
- `status(refreshToken)` — `POST /auth/status.json`
- `recover(email)` / `resetPassword(fields)` — `POST /auth/recover.json` / `POST /auth/reset-password.json`
- `createAuthorizationRequest(username)`, `pollAuthorizationRequest(uuid, pollToken)`,
  `listAuthorizationRequests()`, `authorizeAuthorizationRequest(uuid, password)`,
  `denyAuthorizationRequest(uuid)` — the device-authorization flow's five endpoints (see
  `docs/agents/modules/auth.md`'s "Device-authorization flow" section)

`register`/`login`/`refresh` and a winning `pollAuthorizationRequest` all persist the response's
`refreshToken` via `client/AuthSession.js` before resolving; `logout` clears it unconditionally,
even when the request itself fails, so the client-side session always ends. `AuthSession` is a
thin `localStorage` wrapper (`get`/`set`/`clear`/`isLoggedIn`) around a single key — the access
token itself is never touched by the frontend at all, since the backend sets it as an `httpOnly`
cookie (see `docs/agents/modules/auth.md`'s JWT/refresh-token flow).

`client/ApiClient.js` reacts to a `401` transparently rather than surfacing it to callers: it
reads the stored refresh token, calls `POST /auth/refresh.json` directly (a plain internal
request, not through `AccountsClient`, to avoid a circular import), persists the renewed
`refreshToken`, and retries the original request exactly once. If there is no stored refresh
token, or the refresh call itself fails (invalid/expired/already-revoked refresh token) or the
retried request comes back `401` again, `ApiClient` treats the session as expired: it clears
`AuthSession` and opens the login modal in Password mode via `client/LoginModalEvents.js`,
instead of resolving/rejecting the original call normally or redirecting to a dedicated route.

### Login modal

`components/common/loginModal/LoginModal.jsx` is the single, route-independent entry point for
every auth interaction — standalone login/register pages no longer exist. It is opened/closed
via the shared `client/LoginModalEvents.js` bus (from the header, from `ApiClient`'s
session-expired handling above, or from `components/common/ModalRedirect.jsx`, which the
`#/login` and `#/register` hash routes resolve to so a direct link still opens the modal in the
right mode) and driven by `LoginModalController`/`useLoginModal`/`useDeviceCountdown`. Its modes:

- **Password** / **Register** — the classic username/password flows; both converge on the same
  success path (close the modal, redirect home).
- **Recover** / **Set-new-password** — `AccountsClient.recover`/`resetPassword`; the modal stays
  open on a neutral/success result panel instead of redirecting.
- **Authorize-with-logged-device** — drives `AccountsClient.createAuthorizationRequest` then
  hands off to `utils/polling/AuthorizationRequestPoller.js`, which polls
  `pollAuthorizationRequest` on a 5s cadence until the request is approved, rejected
  (`denied`/`expired`/`logged`), or a `404` (`notFound`) is thrown; a winning `approved` poll
  converges on the same success path as Password/Register. The modal shows a waiting panel with a
  countdown (driven by a 1s ticker down to the request's `expiresAt`) while polling, then its own
  terminal panel.

The approving device reviews and resolves open requests from the "My account" page
(`components/resources/accounts/pages/AuthorizationRequests.jsx` +
`AuthorizationRequestsController`/`AuthorizationRequestsHelper`), which calls
`AccountsClient.listAuthorizationRequests`/`authorizeAuthorizationRequest`/
`denyAuthorizationRequest` — see `docs/agents/modules/auth.md` for the backend contract behind
all of this.

`components/common/header/Header.jsx` keeps `loggedIn`/`isAdmin` state in sync with the shared
`client/AuthEvents.js` bus (via `useAuthEffect`, confirmed at mount time through
`HeaderController#checkStatus`, which calls `AccountsClient.status`) rather than only reading
`AuthSession.isLoggedIn()` once at render time, so it reacts to any auth-state change (login,
logout, or a winning device-authorization poll) independently of a page redirect. It shows a
Login nav link when logged out, or a Logout action when logged in. Logging out calls
`AccountsClient.logout` and redirects home regardless of whether the request succeeded, since
`AccountsClient.logout` already clears `AuthSession` unconditionally.

## No Vite proxy to the backend

There is no Vite `server.proxy` config pointing at the backend — that's the Tent proxy's job
(see `architecture/proxy.md`), not Vite's. In dev, Tent forwards non-asset requests to the Vite
dev server for HMR; Vite itself never talks to the backend directly.

See `.claude/agents/frontend.md` for local dev commands, code conventions, and the JSX
extraction rules.
